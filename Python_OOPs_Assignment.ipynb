        " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs using objects, which are like real-life things that have data (like properties) and actions (like functions or methods). It helps make programs easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties (data) and methods (actions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction and encapsulation are both key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming but serve different purposes. Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object, helping to reduce complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        " On the other hand, encapsulation is about bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components to protect data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods are built-in methods in Python that start and end with double underscores and allow you to customize the behavior of your objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        " - Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the concept where a new class (called a child or subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors (variables and methods) from an existing class (called a parent or superclass). It allows code reuse and helps in building a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means the ability of different classes to respond to the same method name in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation is achieved in Python by restricting access to the internal data of a class using access modifiers and providing methods to get or set values. This helps protect the data and control how it is accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__ that is automatically called when you create a new object from a class. Its main purpose is to initialize the object's attributes with specific values when the object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - Class methods in Python are methods marked with the @classmethod decorator that receive the class (cls) as the first argument and can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static methods are methods marked with the @staticmethod decorator that do not receive an implicit first argument and behave like regular functions inside a class, typically used for utility tasks that don’t access instance or class data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different type or number of arguments) within the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) happens when a child class provides its own version of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the child class to change or extend the behavior of that method while keeping the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator @property that allows you to define methods in a class that behave like attributes (i.e., you can access them without parentheses). It is used to control access to private variables by creating getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean and readable way.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it lets different objects use the same method name to do things in their own way. This makes code simpler, more flexible, and easier to expand or change without rewriting a lot. It helps different objects work together smoothly even if they are different types.\n",
        "\n",
        " 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be a base class for other classes. It often contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but without an implementation. Subclasses must override and provide their own version of these abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        " 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - The main advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are :\n",
        "\n",
        " Code Reusability: You can use existing classes and create new ones by extending them, which saves time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        " Modularity: Code is organized into separate objects or classes, making it easier to manage and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        " Easy Maintenance: Since code is modular and organized, fixing bugs or adding new features becomes simpler.\n",
        "\n",
        " Data Protection: Encapsulation hides the internal data of objects, protecting it from unintended changes.\n",
        "\n",
        " Flexibility with Polymorphism: Different objects can be used interchangeably while behaving differently, making programs more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - The key difference between a class variable and an instance variable:\n",
        " Class Variable:\n",
        " A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. It belongs to the class itself, so if you change it, the change is seen by all objects created from that class.\n",
        "\n",
        " Instance Variable:\n",
        " A variable that belongs to each individual object (instance). Each object has its own copy, so changing it in one object does not affect others.\n",
        "\n",
        " 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance means a class can have more than one parent class and inherit features from all of them. Multiple inheritance helps create classes that combine different abilities from various parents, but it should be used carefully to avoid complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        " - The purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        " __str__ method:\n",
        " Returns a human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        " Used when you call print() or str() on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        " __repr__ method:\n",
        " Returns an official string representation of an object.\n",
        " Used when you call repr() or inspect the object in the Python shell.\n",
        "\n",
        " 20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " - The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent (super) class inside a child class. It helps you reuse and extend the functionality of the parent class without explicitly naming it, which is especially useful in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        " 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a special (dunder) method called a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when it is no longer in use and is garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        " 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " - The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "  @staticmethod:\n",
        " Doesn’t take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
        " Can’t access or modify class or instance variables.\n",
        " Acts like a regular function, but is placed inside a class for logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        " @classmethod:\n",
        " Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class, not an instance).\n",
        " Can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        " Works with the class itself, not with instances.\n",
        "\n",
        " 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - Polymorphism with inheritance in Python means that different child classes can override the same method from a parent class, and Python can call the correct version automatically, even if you’re referring to the object through a parent class reference.\n",
        "\n",
        " 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another. This is done by having each method return the object (self) so the next method can be called on it.\n",
        "\n",
        " 25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you define __call__ in a class, you can use the object with parentheses and it will execute the __call__ method.\n",
